Say Hello to HTML Elements

First, you'll start by building a simple web page using HTML. You can edit code in your code editor, which is embedded into this web page.

Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.

Opening tags look like this:

<h1>
Closing tags look like this:

</h1>
The only difference between opening and closing tags is the forward slash after the opening bracket of a closing tag.

/* 

<h1>Hello World</h1>

*/
